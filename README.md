# Sudoku (Python)

The Sudoku game, created using Python and pygame, offers a simple yet enjoyable mouse-click and keyboard input interface.
It features three difficulty levels and handy options like resetting, restarting, and exiting the game. When the board is correctly filled out, a wining screen awaits your victory.


* The program **begins** with a home screen.
* **The home screen** welcomes the user and asks them to **select a difficulty**.
* The difficulties include, **Easy, Medium, and Hard**
* The **harder** the difficulty, the more **empty cells**
